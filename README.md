# Movie_recommender
A content-based movie recommendation system built with Python. Uses `pandas` for data processing, `CountVectorizer` for text vectorization, and `cosine similarity` to find similar movies. The system combines movie overviews and genres to recommend top 5 movies based on input. Implements machine learning and natural language processing techniques.
